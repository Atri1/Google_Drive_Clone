# Google_Drive_Clone
 ## Creating a clone for Google Drive. 
 
 **1. One can add folder, delete folder, edit and rename folder in this Google Drive like folder management system**
 
 **2. The project persists the previously created folders. So they are not lost when server is closed**
 
 ## Workflow:
 1. So here, user clicks on "Add Folder" button and gives a name to the folder.

2. If the folderName already exists there is a alert that there is already existing folder.

3. You must give folder a name if you want to have a new folder, you cannot leave it blank.
